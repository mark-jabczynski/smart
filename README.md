# smart

Ofc the solution is not efficient but I wanted to show some SOLID and OOP principles in actions + design patters

"Secondly, the test is for us to see how you code and the methodologies you use, what we will be looking for in this test are the following:(...)"

# Tutorial

1. To run script `./script.rb <ARG1> <ARG2> <ARG3>`

* ARG1 stands for the path for the file
* ARG2 stands for operation one of the following [most_views most_unique_views]
* ARG3 stands for a number of the top elements (default 5)

I hope that u can forgive me creativity with ARG2/3 ;)

2. U can also run tests with RSpec

`rspec reader_spec.rb parser_spec.rb stats/most_unique_views_spec.rb stats/most_views_spec.rb`
